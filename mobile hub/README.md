## Overview of the Mobile Hub

The Mobile Hub will:

1. Receive ultrasonic data from the blind stick via Bluetooth

2. Receive image/voice data from the AI glasses

3. Process both streams

4. Provide audio + vibration feedback

5. Offer SOS support


## How it Works

1. Blind Stick: Sends ultrasonic distance readings via Bluetooth.

2. AI Glasses: Sends image feed and audio requests.

3. Mobile Hub: Receives both, processes, and gives voice alerts.

4. Designed to be modular, so you can later integrate:

5. YOLO/BLIP/Gemini for AI vision

6. GPS for navigation

7. SOS module
